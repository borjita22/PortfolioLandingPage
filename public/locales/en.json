    "about_title": "ABOUT",
    "about_text_1": "Hi! My name is Borja Garc√≠a and I am a video game and web developer. I was born in Oviedo, the capital of Asturias, and I currently live in the city of Madrid. From a very young age I wanted to dedicate myself to video game development since this is one of my great passions. For this reason, I studied software engineering at the University of Oviedo before completing my degree in video game and virtual application design and development.",
    "about_text_2": "On a personal level, apart from developing video games on a personal level, my biggest hobbies are reading (something I have been doing constantly since I was very young), sports and hanging out with my family and friends. I also love travelling, and I have been lucky enough to have been able to visit many places despite my age. In addition to all this, I feel very drawn to the world of writing, and I am currently developing a series of fantastic science fiction novels that I hope you will enjoy reading one day as much as I am enjoying developing them.",
    "about_text_3": "As for my skills, I consider that two of my main qualities at a professional level are proactivity and ambition. Always willing to go one step further in all my projects, I always try to achieve the highest possible degree of perfection during their development. Other qualities that I consider to characterize me are leadership capacity and communication, always trying to establish a good working environment wherever I am carrying out my activity.",
